# servo-crane
A small crane made from servo motors and an arduino

My crane design involved a servo motor (180 degrees) operating on a platform, swiveling parallel to the ground.
On the platform are two servo motors (360) with fishing line attached to the plastic crane arm and a bucket that extends out
of the crane arm.
Each of the arms reels in the bucket and the arm so the base can turn around and lower the bucket and arm so that the bucket
spills its content on a small slope that leads back to the main reserve. The bucket and arm are picked up again and rotate
back to the reserve, where they are cast out again to get more water. It acts like a small indoor fountain in this way.
